# ASL Gesture Recognition

This project detects American Sign Language (ASL) letters using a deep learning model. The project contains scripts for training the model, collecting training data, and recognizing gestures using a webcam.

## Files in the Project:

- **ASL.ipynb**: The main notebook for training the ASL recognition model. It handles data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **grab_coordinates.ipynb**: A notebook for capturing training images via the webcam to train the model.
- **mp_imports.py**: A utility script for importing common ML and computer vision libraries like TensorFlow and OpenCV.
- **asl_recognition_model.h5**: The trained model in HDF5 format for gesture recognition.
- **saved_model.pb**: The trained model in TensorFlow's SavedModel format.

## Requirements:

- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
